1. SUBJECT STATEMENT
• What is Mathematics?
Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and relationships between them. It is a
language that attempts to describe the world in abstract terms that can be modified and
therefor often simplified in this language. One can therefor give the student of Mathematics
insight, circumspection, foresight and a measure of control in that areas of reality that can
be so described.
Mathematics is one of the most important subjects for University degrees purposes for two
reasons:
- It forms the basis for most Scientific Degrees and is fundamental also to most
commercial degrees too.
- It is one of the most challenging subjects and students who perform well in it show
evidence of hard work and insight into critical thinking and problem solving.
Mathematics however is not expressly only taught to prepare students for university but
rather to teach students invaluable cognitive skills that can be applied in almost any
sphere of life. It is not the intention of the curriculum to be relevant or relate to real life but
rather to produce minds that can reason using Mathematical principles in their relevant
interests and real lives.
Therefor encourage your students not to study to pass an exam, but rather to endeavour
to think; to grapple to understand absolutely every aspect of the content and to apply their
new reasoning in the way they live and make decisions.
• Aims of subject.
- To develop fluency in computation skills without relying on the usage of calculators.
- To provide the opportunity to develop in learners the ability to be methodical, to
generalize, make conjectures and try to justify or prove them.
- To be able to understand and work with number system.
- To promote accessibility of Mathematical content to all learners. It could be
achieved by catering for learners with different needs.
- To develop problem-solving and cognitive skills. Teaching should not be limited to
“how” but should rather feature the “when” and “why” of problem types. Learning
procedures and proofs without a good understanding of why they are important will
leave learners ill-equipped to use their knowledge in later life.
- To prepare the learners for further education and training as well as the world of
work.
• Time allocation in the curriculum
For Grade 10-12 a minimum of 4,5 hours per week must be spent on Mathematics.
• Requirements to offer Mathematics as a subject
- A competent Mathematics Teacher
- Or a SACAI registered service provider.

2. COGNITIVE LEVELS
Understanding the Cognitive Level is very important in both teaching and assessments. In Mathematics, we distinguish between 4 cognitive levels:
Knowledge, Routine Procedures, Complex Procedures and Problem Solving.
In a later section a thorough explanation and allocation of skills will be assigned to the different cognitive levels but for now here follows a brief
explanation of each cognitive skill

Knowledge Routine Procedures Complex Procedures Problem Solving

Final Exam
Weighting* 20% 35% 30% 15%

Content

Knowledge forms the
foundation of the content that
is to be learnt. It is that
content that students must
know off by heart.

Routine Procedures are the
standard methods and
application of the theory. It is
typically the examples shown
in class or in the textbooks.

Complex Procedures may
also be a standard method
but then it involves
application from various
topics or multiple steps to find
solutions.

Problem solving is not
expressly taught in content
but rather it is the overall aim
of the subject: to solve
problems and use the content
of the lower levels to do so.

In Assessments

In assessments, knowledge
questions are the lowest
order levels that require
minimal cognitive functions
such as recalling, reading of,
automatic procedures, etc.

These are the types of
questions that students will
have encountered in the
class, textbook examples and
common practice questions.

This is the type of question
that usually involves
combining methods from
different topics or analysing
results or questions that are
just not just a normal
application of what was
learnt.

This type of question is not
necessarily difficult nor does
it always require complex
procedures, but before any
method or application of the
theory can be made some
problem must be eliminated
first or insight into the
scenario must be recognized.
Once that has been done the
rest of the solution may be
knowledge, routine or
complex.
A problem-solving question is
not a question that students
have ever seen before
(therefor do not use questions

SACAI MATHEMATICS SUBJECT GUIDELINES GRADE 10-12

Last updated: July 2021 4
from past papers as problem
solving questions).

Expected
student ability

Student should have the
knowledge that should come
without reasoning or
calculating, but simple recall
or reading off.

Students should immediately
know what to do or what
steps to follow to answer the
question.

Student should be able to
figure out which procedures
to follow to answer these
questions but not before
thinking carefully about how
to proceed.

Only students that think,
reason and have a good
grasp of the content will be
able to solve problems.
* It is recommended that as much time is spent in the learning program on each topic’s cognitive skills in proportion to the weighting it
will have in the final exam, however, it is the educator’s responsibility to evaluate if a group should rather focus on the lower levels,

since the higher order levels are impossible if level 1 and 2 is not internalised.

3. OUTLINE OF CURRICULUM
3.1 Learning content
The following is detailed outline of the curriculum content for Grade 10-12. It categorises all the knowledge and skills under the cognitive
skills for that grade and the weighting that the learning area has in the final exam. This weighting should therefore be a guide to how

4. ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES
4.1.1 Informal or daily assessment
SACAI promotes and encourages alternative methods of education and assessment.
Though the formal assessment program is rigid the intention is that all assessment should
be learning opportunities.
The Informal assessment provide the opportunity for each educator to design methods of
assessment that will benefit a specific group and its individuals. These may off course
include smaller tests (specifically testing Cognitive level 1 and 2 skills) but should also
include alternative forms such as investigations, discussions, presentations, research
papers and practical applications.
4.1.2 Formal assessment (SBA requirements)
The formal assessments are all those components that contribute with the final exam to
the final mark. The following is a description of each type of assessment in the
Assessment Program.
NO SBA TASKS MAY BE USED FROM TEXTBOOK TO WHICH THE STUDENT HAVE
ACCESS. If a task is used from a resource, it may not be copied from the resource but
must be retyped.
YOU MAY NOT GIVE A PAST EXAM PAPER AS AN EXAM PAPER. If past papers are
used to set exam question it must come from a range of different papers and other
resources. Remember problem solving questions must be questions that students have
never seen before, therefor they may not be from past papers to which students may have
access.
Here follows an explanation of what constitutes an exam, test, assignment, investigation or
project.
▪ Examinations
All tests and Exams have a timed duration of 1,2 Minutes per mark
Midyear Exams
The midyear exams must be conducted under strict examination procedures and time
keeping.
The question paper does NOT have to follow the exact format for the final exam as
stipulated by the exam guidelines, but it must be weighted appropriately according to
the weightings in the final exam with regards to the topics and cognitive distribution.
The exam therefor does not have to be two exam papers, but a single paper of 150
marks for 3 hours will be sufficient or two papers for 100 marks may also be sufficient.
No notes, books or any other resource may be used or retained by the learners during
the exam.

SACAI MATHEMATICS SUBJECT GUIDELINES GRADE 10-12

Last updated: July 2021 45
The Prelim exams
Grade 12 learners write another examination before the final exam called the
preliminary or trial exams. It is important and advised that this exam follows the format
that the candidate may expect in the final exam and it has to be two 3 hour papers of
150 marks each.
This exam is done under the strictest possible examination conditions.
▪ Control Test
All tests and Exams have a timed duration of 1 - 2 Minutes per mark
Control Tests are also done under strict exam conditions. Again, students may not use
notes, books or any other resource to answer control test questions.
Control tests are recommended to be only a 1 hour paper of 50 marks each.
At least one control test is done every term (except in term 4 for grade 12 who will do a
prelim exam) and should therefore be based on topics addressed in that term. It
should be restricted to 2 or at most 3 topics. Because of this it is recommended that
only current grade topics be assessed.
Control tests must be weighted proportionally to what can be expected in the final
exam with regards to topics and cognitive levels.
▪ Assignments
Assignments are tasks that student may complete in their own time at home. Therefor
an assignment will be based on more challenging questions in a given topic, in other
words it will only consist of complex procedures and problem-solving questions. It
should not contain questions that the students have seen before.
Despite not being done under controlled conditions it remains an individual task and
students may not copy each other’s work or assist each other.
▪ Investigation
Either a project OR investigation set in a year not both. Investigations are set to
develop the skills of systematic investigation into special cases with a view to
observing general trends, making conjectures and proving them. To avoid having to
assess work which is copied without understanding, it is recommended that while the
initial investigation can be done at home, the final write up should be done in class,
under supervision, without access to any notes. Investigations are marked using
rubrics which can be specific to the task, or generic, listing the number of marks
awarded for each skill:
40% for communicating individual ideas and discoveries, assuming the reader has not
come across the text before. The appropriate use of diagrams and tables will enhance
the investigation. 35% for the effective consideration of special cases; 20% for
generalising, making conjectures and proving or disproving these conjectures; and
5% for presentation: neatness and visual impact.

SACAI MATHEMATICS SUBJECT GUIDELINES GRADE 10-12

Last updated: July 2021 46
▪ Projects
Either a project or investigation should be done in a year, not both. The assessment
criteria need to be clearly indicated on the project specification. The focus should be
on the mathematics involved and not on duplicated pictures and regurgitation of facts
from reference material.
Projects are also marked with a Rubric.

Marking guidelines
All Marking Guidelines must have the following features
▪ Neatly typed out
▪ Alternative solutions
▪ Mark allocations
▪ Explanations of marks
▪ Indication of Cognitive Level

Here is an example:
?.? Consider the diagram

-2 -1 1 2 3
-1
1
2
3

x

y

f
g

Find the value for x for which
?.?.1 f(x) = g(x) (1)

x = −1 ✓

?.?.2 g(x) − f(x) = 2 (2)

x = 0 ✓✓ Answer only

(If incorrect answer one mark can be
given if the student somehow showed
that g(x)-f(x) is the distance between
the two graphs

?.?.3 f
−1
(g(x)) = −2 (3)
f
−1
(k) = −2
k = 3
k = g(x) = 3
x = 1

Or
If the inverse for f at g(x) gives a value
-2 then f(-2) is equal to g(x).
g(x) = 3 and g(x)=3 for x = 1
Or
f
−1
(g(x)) = −2
g(x) = f(−2)
g(x) = 3
x = 1

OR
f
−1
(x) = log1
2
(x + 1)

f
−1
(g(x)) = −2
log1
2
( x + 2 + 1) = −2
(
1
2
)
−2
= x + 3
4 = x + 3
x = 1

✓ correct interpretation of the
expression
✓ correct value for g(x)
✓ Final answer followed up previous
step.

In this Example the colour of the tick marks represented the Cognitive level as defined by
a Key at the beginning of the memorandum.

9 EXAMINATION PAPERS AND CONTROLLED TESTS
(See EXAMINATION GUIDELINES (Sect C) for GRADE 12 information)

5.1.1 Format of controlled tests and examination papers

All tests and Examinations must have the following format that should be displayed on the
front of the question paper
• Date
• Total
• Time allocation (All tests and Exams have a timed duration of 1,2 Minutes per mark
• Test Name: E.g. Control Test 1 or Midyear Exam Paper 1

5.1.2 Mark allocation
Mark allocation must be clearly indicated next to each question and the assessor should
use the following principles to allocate marks:
1. Each mark should reflect a significant cognitive process
2. the total marks should reflect an average thinking and writing time of 1 - 2 min per
mark.
Based on these principles here are some suggestions on what marks may be awarded for.
A mark may be awarded for:
• recalling a fact or specific formula only once.
• the method if it is a valid option to a solution
• writing an expression in its standard form
• each correct factorization.
• for each factor in more complicated or unusual factorization
• correct substitution (but not per value substituted)
• each correct conversion of values before they are applied or once in the application
• each significant application step
• a correct application of a law, definition or theorem
• significant simplification steps
• interim answers, that will be used to get to the final
• final answers correctly rounded and including units (if applicable)
• each important characteristic of a graph drawn
• correctly plotting a coordinate (or even a few)
• for a yes/no answer and another mark if it requires a reason.
• for each relevant insight in a reasoning.
• recognizing a pattern or application of theory.

5.1.3 Cognitive Analysis
We have at length explained the importance and differentiation of cognitive levels thus
far, but here is a short summary:
Cognitive
Level Description

Knowledge

Knowledge marks are awarded for recalling from memory or skills that
should be part of the
learner’s skillset in the grade.
• Straight recall of facts
o Definitions
o Theorems
• Mundane Procedure
o Marks awarded for very simple calculation
o Marks awarded for calculation that is considered single step
routine procedure in a lower grade

Routine
Procedures

Generally routine procedure marks are awarded for steps and
applications that a learner would have encountered in the class and
textbooks.
• Generally, questions that are similar to what has been encountered
in the class for that grade.
• Basic repeatable procedure for solving problems that has been
taught
• Drawing graphs when the essential information is available
• Prescribed proofs and derivations of formulas
• Grade specific marks awarded for
o substitution
o solving
o simplifying
o estimation or rounding of an answer
o using the correct formula
o changing the subject of an equation
• Straight forward application of knowledge and theory for that grade

Complex
Procedures

Complex Procedure marks are awarded to for calculations that go
beyond what is normally encountered in class, or it relies on application
of a combination of themes. Complex procedure marks are generally not
rewarded for single marks.
• Common procedures in an uncommon, not immediately recognisable
format.
• Complex calculations
• Questions that require different routine procedures to find the final
answer.
• Requires application of topics from different themes
• Higher order reasoning: Analyse, evaluate or create
o Evaluations and interpretations
o Not prescribed proofs and deriving of formulas

Problem
Solving

Could be knowledge, routine or complex procedure but first requires a
problem-solving step or insight into a unique scenario that is not
apparent or has not been formally taught.

5.3.1 Cognitive analysis Grids for tests/question papers

ALL TESTS AND EXAMINATIONS MUST HAVE A COGNITIVE ANALYSIS GRID.
The cognitive analysis grid is a tool / table that allocates each mark or question into the
relevant cognitive skill category. The totals are added up and shown as a percentage of
the total. This must be distributed in accordance with what can be expected in the final
exam, in other words:
Knowledge Routine
